# Python-script-for-data-analysis
To get data from a Snowflake table and write it into an Excel file, you'll need to use the snowflake-connector-python and pandas libraries to connect to Snowflake and manipulate the data. You'll also need the openpyxl library to write the data to an Excel file. 


# First, you need to install the required libraries:
pip install snowflake-connector-python pandas openpyxl

Replace the placeholder values (in angle brackets) with your Snowflake account details and the name of the table you want to fetch data from. Run the script to fetch the data and create an Excel file:
python snowflake_to_excel.py


For basic data analysis in Excel, you can use Excel's built-in features like sorting, filtering, and pivot tables. You can also use Excel functions such as "AVERAGE", "SUM", "COUNT", "MAX", "MIN", and others to perform calculations on the data.
